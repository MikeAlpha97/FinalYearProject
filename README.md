## Abstract:
Caption It’ is a native mobile application.
This mobile app has one major and rest of minor tasks.
The core task of the mobile application is that it will be
able to generate captions for any kind of image provided by 
the user. The user can choose to save the generated results
by registering himself on the application. Although the task
looks simply just captioning a given image however all the
major work behind this caption generation magic is done in
the backend of the mobile application on its server side. 
The major work which is image captioning is an outcome of 
multiple concepts of deep learning, machine learning and 
natural language processing also known as NLP, all combined
in harmony to generate the expected outcome. These concepts 
are used to build a neural network based models and then thorough 
training and testing of these very models in the end provides us 
with a complete human brain like automated system which is 
able to generate a natural language description 
for any given image. 
Node Js and Express Js make up the backend server framework 
while the mobile application’s front end is developed with 
React Native and MongoDB is being used as the database. 
All these things combined together finally output
the practical implementation of the application Caption It’.
